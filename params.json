{"body":"##Foreword\r\nThis is preliminary work for an H-Bot configuration based reprap, with a rather large build volume.\r\n\r\nThe main advantage of this kind of setup is its mechanical simplicity, so with that in mind, I plan to make this very easy to build and hopefully just as easy to calibrate etc.\r\n\r\nThis is of course fully parametric, thanks to Openscad!\r\n\r\nFor now this is still in the <b>very</b> early prototyping phase, so almost nothing is in a 100% usable state, but I hope to have a fully working prototype by September.\r\nUntil then, expect the files to change a lot !\r\n(and feedback is always welcome)\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n- H-bot design\r\n- Maximum build size (not set in stone): 220*350*400 mm\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n- Requires the MCad (openscad) library\r\n\r\n##Progress:\r\n<b>Things that are finalized:</b>\r\n- X ends\r\n\r\n<b>Next to be finalized:</b>\r\n- x carriage\r\n- \"box\" structure angle elements\r\n\r\n<b>Not done at all:</b>\r\n- z axis elements\r\n\r\n##Bill of materials(totally incomplete for now)\r\n- 8mm smooth rods\r\n- lm8UU linear bearings X10\r\n- 5mm wood plank (used for build platform and structure)\r\n- 4mm dia nuts & bolts (12mm long) X6 for x_ends\r\n\r\n## Media\r\n- first X/Y movement test of prototype (running Marlin firmware with CoreX/Y support enabled)\r\n<http://www.youtube.com/embed/a4HLpNbQznU>","name":"Doboz-2","google":"","tagline":"All files instruction and information for the Doboz 2 H-Bot reprap","note":"Don't delete this file!
